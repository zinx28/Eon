# Eon-Launcher (Build on DEV TESTING x64)
This was just eon v1 src

- `https://github.com/zinx28/Eon/blob/main/UiDesktopApp5/Window1.xaml.cs` this contains the apis for login

# Theres difference branches wow!
- I've changed some stuff (like made updater local host)
- Some launcher ui has been deleted when i was going to use this for hydro but never did
- Dev mode wont support updater unless you add it
- DO NOT USE HEADLESS (this mode wasnt made proper)

# Login Api (Not added - port 2936)
- GET launcher/token/:token 
- Responds back as { Email: "" }
